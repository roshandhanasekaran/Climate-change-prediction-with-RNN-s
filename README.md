# Climate-change-prediction-with-RNN-s

This paper attempts to predict weather information using the Australian Weather Dataset and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). In the paper, we perform preliminary data analysis (PDA), and data preparation techniques were deployed on the data to be used with an RNN. After the PDA, we use vanilla RNNs, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) RNNs, and Gated Recurrent Networks (GRU) to predict the median temperature and compare the results. The models are evaluated with the training dataset and then estimated with the testing dataset to get the final outputs. The advantages and limitations of each of the Neural Networks are analysed and discussed as well. The results of the analysis are discussed with suitable visualization to make them easier to communicate. This project was implemented using the Python programming language along with TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, and Sklearn. Plotly was used for the visualization of the outputs. In general, it was found that RNNs are good for predicting sequential data but LSTMs and GRUs performed better when forecasting farther in the future.
